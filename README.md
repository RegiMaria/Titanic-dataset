**The Titanic dataset**

The Titanic dataset is part of a 'Kaggle challenge' in which participants
were supposed to use the 'Titanic passenger data' (name, age, ticket price, etc.) to try to predict who will survive and who will die. I took the opportunity to start using Python libraries and to start on my first project in Jupyter Notebook.

This project was executed in Jupyter Notebook and made use of:

-Python
-Pandas
-Numpy
-Matplotlib

It is recommended to use Anaconda, which includes all the necessary libraries.

-Explore data with Pandas
-Clean and analyze data
-Build plots with Matplotlib
-Export files
